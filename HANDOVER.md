# Project Handover: Short Domain Worker

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a high-performance, scalable short domain service built entirely on the Cloudflare serverless stack. It provides an API to create short, manageable URLs that redirect to longer destination URLs.

The primary goal is to offer a fast and reliable link shortening service that can be deployed globally with minimal latency, leveraging Cloudflare Workers for compute at the edge and Workers KV for data storage.

## 2. Core Functionality Implemented

- **Link Creation**: An API endpoint at `POST /s` accepts a long URL and an optional custom shortcode. 
- **Link Redirection**: All other paths (e.g., `GET /:short_code`) are treated as short links. The service looks up the code in the database and performs a 302 redirect to the destination URL if found. If not found, it returns a 404 error.
- **Custom & Random Shortcodes**: 
    - If a user provides a custom shortcode, the service checks for its availability.
    - If the custom code is taken, or if no custom code is provided, the service generates a unique, random 6-character code.
    - The random generation process is robust and includes a check to prevent collisions, ensuring every generated code is unique.

## 3. Technical Architecture

- **Runtime**: [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- **Framework**: [Hono](https://hono.dev/) (A small, fast, and lightweight web framework for the edge).
- **Storage**: [Cloudflare Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv/) (A global, low-latency key-value data store).
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Project Structure

The worker-related code is organized within the `src/worker/` directory to maintain a clean separation of concerns:

- `index.ts`: The main entry point for the worker. It initializes the Hono app and defines the routes, delegating the logic to the appropriate handlers.
- `handlers/`: Contains the business logic for handling requests.
    - `shorten.ts`: Manages the logic for the `POST /s` endpoint, including validating input, checking for custom code availability, generating new codes, and storing the link in KV.
    - `redirect.ts`: Manages the redirection logic for `GET /:short_code`.
- `utils.ts`: Holds utility functions, such as `generateShortCode`, which can be shared across different parts of the application.
- `types.ts`: Defines shared TypeScript types, primarily the Hono application type with correct environment bindings (`App`).

## 4. Summary of Modifications & Key Decisions

As the initial developer, I performed the following key tasks:

1.  **Initial Scaffolding**: Established the project structure by creating the `handlers`, `utils`, and `types` files for a clean, modular architecture.
2.  **KV Namespace Configuration**:
    - Configured the `wrangler.json` file to include a `kv_namespaces` binding named `LINKS`.
    - Created both production and preview KV namespaces using `wrangler` CLI commands.
    - Updated `worker-configuration.d.ts` to make the `LINKS` binding available to TypeScript as a global type.
3.  **Core Logic Implementation**: Wrote the handlers for both creating and redirecting links, and the utility for generating random codes.
4.  **Collision Handling**: Addressed a potential race condition where a randomly generated shortcode could already exist. The `handleShorten` function now uses a `do...while` loop to check the KV store after generation, guaranteeing the uniqueness of every new link.
5.  **TypeScript Build Fix**: Resolved a critical build error (`Cannot find name 'KVNamespace'`) by:
    - Installing the `@cloudflare/workers-types` package.
    - Updating `tsconfig.worker.json` to include these types, allowing the TypeScript compiler to recognize Cloudflare-specific globals.
6.  **Enhanced `handleShorten` Logic**:
    - Added an `auto_create` boolean parameter to the `POST /s` endpoint.
    - If a requested `custom_code` already exists and `auto_create` is `false` or undefined, the API now returns the existing link's data instead of creating a new one.
    - If `auto_create` is `true`, the service generates a new random code, preserving the old behavior.
7.  **Documentation**: 
    - Created a comprehensive `README.md` with clear instructions for setup, local development, and API usage.
    - Updated `package.json` with an appropriate project name and description.

## 5. How to Run Locally

A developer can get started by following these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
2.  **Configure KV**: Run `npx wrangler kv namespace create "LINKS"` and `npx wrangler kv namespace create "LINKS" --preview`. Then, copy the resulting `id` and `preview_id` into `wrangler.json`.
3.  **Run Development Server**: `npm run dev`. The worker will be accessible at `http://localhost:8787`.

## 6. Suggestions for Future Development

- **Analytics**: Track the number of clicks for each short link. This could be achieved by adding a counter in the KV value or using a separate Analytics Engine.
- **Link Management**: Implement API endpoints for deleting or updating existing short links, potentially protected by an authentication mechanism.
- **Frontend UI**: The project template includes a React setup. A simple UI could be built to allow users to create short links without using `curl`.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to provide more specific feedback to the user (e.g., invalid URL format).
- **Custom Domain**: For a production deployment, the worker should be attached to a custom short domain.
